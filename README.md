# ROOM HOME PAGE --> 100days of code 

### description
This project was a little bit more than the others, even though I have tried 
to use the best practices but I still feel that it is missing a little bit more.
 In order to finish it for sure in the future, like everything else I will use 
 testing, to see in which cases it could fail and leave it more prepared.

this repository is made with React Css-Modules, TypeScript and as a packager 
I use vite not yet there added also use bun to run locally the project when it 
was in development mode, I used a json to store the dynamic content if I add more 
would make it quite simple and also I used only two state one to show or hide the 
Mobile mode menu and another for the dynamic content along with a useEffect.
